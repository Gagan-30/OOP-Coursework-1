# ZombieCatcher - CS1811 Formative Coursework

This is a Java-based program that simulates a system for tracking potential zombie outbreaks in venues, such as restaurants, cafes, or other places on campus. The program helps identify potential zombie visitors by checking their visit times against known zombie infection periods.

## Description

This program asks the user to input the time period during which a zombie was known to be on the premises, then identifies which visitors need to be quarantined based on the overlap of their visit times with the known infection period. 

The user can either enter the visitor data manually or supply a list of files with visitor data. If files are provided, the program will process each file and output the names of visitors who might be infected.

### Features:
- **Overlapping periods calculation**: Identifies overlapping time periods between zombie presence and visitor visits.
- **Manual and file-based input**: Allows input of visitor data manually or by reading from a file.
- **Quarantine identification**: Displays which visitors need to be quarantined based on overlapping visit times.
- **File reading capability**: Reads input from a file (visitor’s name, arrival, and departure time).

## Getting Started

To run this project, ensure that you have Java 8 or later installed on your system. You will also need the `ZombieCatcher.java` file and any data files you want to use.

### Prerequisites

1. **Java JDK 8 or later** installed.
   - Install from: [Java Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
2. **CS1811 Assignment Testing Tool** for testing purposes.

### Installation

1. Download or clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ZombieCatcher.git
   cd ZombieCatcher
   ```

2. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac ZombieCatcher.java
   ```

3. Run the program (either manually or with files):
   ```bash
   java ZombieCatcher
   ```

## Running the Program

### 1. Interactive Mode

Run the program and provide the infection period and visitor data via the command line:

```bash
$ java ZombieCatcher
Enter the start time:
5
Enter the end time:
7
Enter the number of visitors:
2
Enter the visitor's name:
Sulaimaan
Enter the arrival time:
4
Enter the departure time:
8
Sulaimaan needs to be quarantined.
Enter the visitor's name:
Dmani
Enter the arrival time:
8
Enter the departure time:
9
Dmani does not need to be quarantined.
Number of potential zombies: 1
```

### 2. File-Based Mode

Alternatively, you can pass file names as arguments, and the program will process the visitor data from the files:

```bash
$ java ZombieCatcher access-log-1.txt access-log-2.txt
Enter the start time:
16
Enter the end time:
18
WARNING: notafile.txt not found.
Amber needs to be quarantined.
Marco needs to be quarantined.
Number of potential zombies: 2
```

## Testing

The program includes automated tests for the functionality. To test your implementation:

1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac ZombieCatcher.java
   ```

2. Run the tester JAR file:
   ```bash
   java -jar cs1811Assignment1ZombieTesterStudent.jar
   ```

This will run a series of automated tests to ensure your program behaves as expected. 

### Example Test Output:

```bash
Running testQ1_00OverlappingPeriodsMethod
Test passed

Running testQ1_01OverlappingPeriodsMethod
Test failed
```

## File Format

For file-based input, the file should contain data in the following format:

```
<name> <arrival_time> <departure_time>
```

Example file content:

```
Yusif 18 19
Amber 17 22
Marco 14 17
```

## Usage Example

To run the program with files and check for potential zombies:

```bash
$ java ZombieCatcher access-log-1.txt access-log-2.txt
Enter the start time:
16
Enter the end time:
18
Amber needs to be quarantined.
Marco needs to be quarantined.
Number of potential zombies: 2
```
